# Moviewebsite_project

This is a movie search app I built using React and the TMDB API. You can search for movies, check out their posters, ratings, and descriptions, and even add your favorites. I built this to practice working with APIs, React Router, and localStorage — and had a lot of fun making it!

## 🚀 Features

-  Search for movies by title
-  View movie details like poster, rating, and year of release
-  Add/remove movies from a favorites list (stored in localStorage)
-  Navigate smoothly using React Router
-  Fully responsive design

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React (with hooks)
- React Router DOM
- TMDB API
- Context API for global state
- LocalStorage
- CSS / Tailwind CSS *(if used)*
